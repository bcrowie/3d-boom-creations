        Phenomenal communication. Fast order and turnaround time from request to 3d print in my hand.

        The print itself (Steam Deck Cable Carrier) is amazing. The slide lid is surprisingly smooth. Fairly priced as well.

        High recommend!`,

        Top notch communication and went the extra mile to make sure I was happy with the print. The print itself was amazing quality and smooth edges all around. Very good prices. Couldnâ€™t be more pleased. The print was for a custom PC front panel for better airflow: https://imgur.com/EC4l5To`,

        QUOTE: `Review for 3DBoomCreations - printer/designer

        General rating 5/5...can I give a 6/5?

        I stumbled my way through a request for one or more board game inserts: https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprintmything/comments/wpdya4/usa_board_game_upgrades_parks_insert_maybe_more/

        From the outset, 3DBoomCreations was amazing. Incredibly fast with their initial communication, which was articulate and proactive. I've never had anything 3D printed before, so they were very patient with my questions and offered up a lot of information that I wouldn't have thought to ask about. Their quoted price seemed more than fair based on my limited knowledge of what to expect, and shipping was blazing fast.

        I want to stress two things in particular - communication and quality. I already mentioned their communication, but this interaction was among the best I've ever had. I've done quite a bit of etsy and personal artist purchasing, and u/cr0wstuf blows all of the communication tied to that out of the water. For the inserts themselves, the level of care that went into making them is evident. They're beautiful, and it looks like lots of extra little touches were made to ensure they were not just functional but also impressive. Beyond that, I asked for three multi-piece inserts and to make my life even easier they were carefully color-coded!

        Thank you so much, 3DBoomCreations! I've only just discovered 3D printing, but this experience will absolutely bring me back.`,
